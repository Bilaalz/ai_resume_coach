# AI Resume Critiquer Pro

## Overview
AI Resume Critiquer Pro is a web application that leverages advanced AI (OpenAI GPT-4o) to analyze resumes, provide actionable feedback, and generate professional reports. Users can upload their resume and a job description, receive detailed analysis, and view all feedback directly in the app.

## Features
- **Resume Upload:** Supports PDF and TXT files for resume analysis.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to provide structured feedback, scores, and rewrite suggestions.
- **Job Description Match:** Calculates semantic similarity between your resume and a job description using NLP techniques.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a modern, responsive user experience.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can adjust analysis depth and preferences.
- **All Feedback In-App:** All analysis and recommendations are displayed directly in the app for easy review and copying.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - For building the interactive web UI
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) - For AI-powered resume analysis
- [PyPDF2](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/) - For extracting text from PDF resumes
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - For TF-IDF vectorization and semantic similarity
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - For data visualization (gauge charts, etc.)
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - For environment variable management
- [pandas, numpy] - For data handling and manipulation

## What I Learned
- **Integrating with APIs:** How to securely use the OpenAI API for advanced text analysis.
- **PDF/Text Processing:** Extracting and handling text from user-uploaded files using PyPDF2 and robust error handling.
- **Building Modern UIs:** Creating interactive, user-friendly apps with Streamlit and custom CSS.
- **Session State Management:** Persisting data across reruns in Streamlit using `st.session_state`.
- **Error Handling:** Providing user-friendly error messages and robust exception handling.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Applying TF-IDF and cosine similarity for semantic matching.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Plotly to create engaging, informative charts.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting prompts to elicit structured, reliable responses from LLMs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- An OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd resume_critiquer
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up your `.env` file:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

### Running the App
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Usage
- Upload your resume (PDF or TXT).
- (Optional) Upload or paste a job description for targeted analysis.
- Click "Analyze Resume" to receive feedback and scores.
- All feedback and suggestions will be displayed directly in the app for you to review and copy.

## Future Improvements
- **User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts and save their analysis history.
- **Analysis History:** Store and display past analyses for easy comparison and tracking progress.
- **Advanced NLP:** Integrate more advanced NLP models or custom keyword extraction for deeper analysis.
- **Support More File Types:** Add support for DOCX and other resume formats.
- **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the interface with more visualizations, themes, and accessibility features.
- **Export Options:** Add options to export feedback as text or other formats (e.g., CSV, DOCX).
- **Customizable Feedback:** Let users select which aspects of their resume to focus on.

## Notes
- Your data is processed securely and never stored.
- For best results, use text-based (not scanned image) PDFs.
- If you encounter issues, check your `.env` file and ensure your OpenAI API key is valid.
